                    <p>My name is Chase Franklin and I am a junior fullstack web developer. I started out learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript at The Iron Yard coding bootcamp in 2016.</p>
                    <p>Since then I have gone on to build online ordering applications, manage WordPress websites, and code emails and content pages for several agencies and startups.</p>
                    <p>I am currently at Wake Technical Community College working through the Web Developer program. I will be earning an Associate of Science Degree in Spring 2024 and I am looking to join a development team where I can share my skills.</p>
